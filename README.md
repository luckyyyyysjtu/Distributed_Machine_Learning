# Distributed Machine Learning

This repository hosts a collection of assignments and projects focusing on big data and large-scale computing using real life datasets like Yelp ratings and LLM model outputs. It covers the entire spectrum of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) pipelines, encompassing tasks such as data cleansing, reduction, modeling, tuning, and prediction. Additionally, the repository delves into the underlying mathematical principles that drive the optimization process, leveraging libraries like NumPy and TensorFlow to implement algorithms from the ground up.

In addition, the repository includes a detailed report that investigates the cutting-edge performance of Language Model (LLM) accuracy in chatbox conversations. The report conducts a thorough comparison of various LLM models, evaluating their performance in terms of verbosity, security, and accuracy. It concludes with actionable recommendations tailored for usage in insurance scenarios.
